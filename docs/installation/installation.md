# Installation

There are multiple ways to install OpenLiteSpeed Web Server. You can install to Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, or AlmaLinux through the LiteSpeed Repository, or you can use one of our other fast setup methods (Cloud Image, Script, and Docker). Some of our alternate setup methods may bundle useful software, such as WordPress, all in one easy setup.
