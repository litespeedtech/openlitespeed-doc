# Using QUIC.cloud CDN with OpenLiteSpeed

QUIC.cloud is a CDN service and a collection of optimization services for WordPress sites, and OpenLiteSpeed users have good reasons to give it a try.

## More Free Bandwidth
Everyone gets free CDN bandwidth and free Online Services credits, but OpenLiteSpeed users get 5X more than non-LiteSpeed users!

## ESI Support
OpenLiteSpeed does not have built-in support for ESI, but QUIC.cloud does. Add QUIC.cloud to your WordPress stack, and take advantage of the ESI settings in the LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress plugin.
